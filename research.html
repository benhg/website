							<strong>Research Statement</strong><br/>
							<p>Much of my research has to do with making high performance and parallel and distributed computing techniques more accessible to people who need to use such techniques but don’t have the necessary skills. Many of these skills involve learning how to perform relatively mundane tasks, like writing task submission scripts for various different high performance scheduler systems and resource managers. Tasks like these are not very interesting or constructive to learn, especially when they are not at all related to the actual research which is being carried out. My research has to do with presenting alternative solutions to problems involving these kinds of tasks. Through this research, the goal is to help make researchers in domains involving high performance computing less dependent upon people who have these skills. My view is that no research should be left unfinished because a researcher didn’t know how to submit a job to a scheduling system.</p>
									
									<p>I have attacked these problems through contributing to a few separate projects. In chronological order, the first project I worked on which was related to these goals was when I was in high school. Over a summer, I designed a prototype of a data search, transfer, and sharing system, which used Globus as an underlying base for file transfer management. This system is a web app which allows scientists and other researchers to log in, view what files they have in public Globus endpoints, transfer them to any other public Globus endpoints they have access to, and open temporary workspaces including any subset of those files. Those workspaces consist of temporary Jupyter notebook servers which allow for users to run simple computation on those data files which live in Globus. After that, users had the option to publish the newly created data files over Globus to any other public endpoint. This project served as a prototype for one aspect of a Globus project called Wholetale, which is aimed as a new method of producing reproducible computational research. The wholesale app presents users with a dashboard allowing them to import registered data, compute on it, and produce clean results.
									</p>
									
									<p>Another project I work on is called <a href="https://parsl-project.org">Parsl</a>. Parsl, which is short for the PARallel Scripting Library, is an open-source, python-based workflow management system. It is a Python library for programming and executing data-oriented workflows (dataflows) in parallel. Parsl scripts allow selected Python functions and external applications (called apps) to be connected by shared input/output data objects into flexible parallel workflows. Rather than explicitly defining a dependency graph and/or modifying data structures, instead developers simply annotate Python functions and Parsl constructs a dynamic, parallel execution graph derived from the implicit linkage between apps based on shared input/output data objects. I have worked with the Parsl team on various pieces of Parsl, including designing and building support for execution on clouds, including Google cloud, Amazon EC2, and Microsoft Azure. Due to that work, researchers can automatically perform computational tasks transparently across many different execution platforms, including personal computers, commercial and scientific clouds, grids, clusters, and supercomputers.									</p>
							<p>At Lewis & Clark, we recently acquired our first high-performance computing system. We have a small cluster computer which is partly dedicated to computational research on campus, but is also dedicated to providing students with access to HPC resources in an educational setting. We decided to use this as an opportunity to make HPC accessible to all on campus, regardless of their experience with parallel computing, or computing in general. I have applied some of the techniques and skills I learned from working with the Parsl team and created a usability framework including a number of computational tools, such as Jupyter notebooks and the R studio server. This ecosystem is able to take code from any of these tools and transparently and efficiently execute it on the worker nodes of our system, thereby allowing cluster users to concentrate on the work they are interested in, while allowing the computer cluster and our ecosystem to perform the computational heavy lifting and optimization which allows their results to be computed efficiently and easily.</p>

						  <p>If you want to get in touch with me, the quickest way to do so is probably sending me an email. Also linked here are my GitHub, where I put 
						    most of the code I write and my ResearchGate, where I have copies of most of the interesting things I'm working on.
